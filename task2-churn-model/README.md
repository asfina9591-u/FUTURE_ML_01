# Task 2: Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Objective
Predict which customers are likely to leave the service (churn) using historical data and machine learning techniques.

## 📁 Files Included
- `Customer_Churn_Prediction_using_ML.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`: Dataset containing customer details and churn labels.

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Model training (Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest)
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📈 Results
The model achieved an accuracy of **XX%** (replace with your actual result) and identified key churn indicators like contract type, tenure, and monthly charges.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab
2. Upload the dataset when prompted
3. Run all cells to view analysis and predictions
